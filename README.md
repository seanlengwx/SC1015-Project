# SC1015-Project
Y1 SC1015 Mini-Project

This project aims to determine the factors that contribute an individual's salary. By utilising various machine learning models and specific datasets, we aim to utilise these variables in the dataset to predict an individuals salary and from there, enable one to estimate their potential job salary.


Work Distribution:
- Data Pre-processing                            |  Sean, Jin Jie, Yuan Sheng
- Data Exploration                               |  Sean, Jin Jie, Yuan Sheng
- Data Analysis                                  |  Sean, Jin Jie, Yuan Sheng
- Data preparation for machine learning model    |  Sean, Jin Jie, Yuan Sheng
- Random Forest Regression                       |  Sean, Yuan Sheng
- Gradient Boosting                              |  Jin Jie
- Multinomial Logistic Regression                |  Jin Jie

Models Used:
- Random Forest Regression
- XGBoost
- Multinormial Logistic Regression

What I learned:
- work title, company location, experience level and education level plays a significant role in determinating a good salary
- xgboost
- Multinormial Logistic Regression from sklearn
- Collaborating on github
- After an amount of iterations, the accuracy, area under roc curve, multiclass error slows down by alot
- Not having a good dataset that covers all the variables evenly will mess up the prediction
